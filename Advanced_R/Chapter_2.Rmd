Pre-requisite package.

```{r}
install.packages("lobstr")
```
## 2.2.2 Exercises

### Explain the relationship between a, b, c, and d.

```{R}
a <- 1:10
b <- a
c <- b
d <- 1:10
```

Initial expectations: I expect a, b, and c to be pointing to the same memory location for the vector 1:10. I expect d to be pointing elsewhere.

```{R}
glue::glue("a: {lobstr::obj_addr(a)}")
glue::glue("b: {lobstr::obj_addr(b)}")
glue::glue("c: {lobstr::obj_addr(c)}")
glue::glue("d: {lobstr::obj_addr(d)}")
```
Correct!

If I change a value in c, then a and b should point to same place, but c should change.

```{R}
c[5] <- 0 
glue::glue("a: {lobstr::obj_addr(a)}")
glue::glue("b: {lobstr::obj_addr(b)}")
glue::glue("c: {lobstr::obj_addr(c)}")
glue::glue("d: {lobstr::obj_addr(d)}")
```
Correct!

Strings are supposed to be different. According to the book, they point at a string set.

```{R}
a <- "a"
b <- "ab"
c <- "a"
d <- "ba"
glue::glue("a: {lobstr::obj_addr(a)}")
glue::glue("b: {lobstr::obj_addr(b)}")
glue::glue("c: {lobstr::obj_addr(c)}")
glue::glue("d: {lobstr::obj_addr(d)}")
```
Interesting. a and c are the same string. Based on the book, I would think these would be pointing at the same location. It's expected that b and d would be different and they are.
